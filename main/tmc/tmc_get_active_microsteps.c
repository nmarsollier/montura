/* TMC - tmc_get_active_microsteps.c
 *
 * Purpose: provide the rest of the system with the verified microstep count
 * from the TMC2209 driver, without requiring a UART transaction on every read.
 *
 * The single static variable s_active_microsteps is owned by this file and
 * updated by tmc_set_microsteps() (in tmc_init.c) after each successful
 * hardware write + read-back verification.

/*
 * The verified microstep count from the most recent successful hardware
 * write + read-back. Initialized to 0 (meaning "not yet configured").
 * Updated by tmc_set_microsteps() after successful verification.
 *
 * Both axes are configured identically, so a single value suffices.
